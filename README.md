# notebook

`notebook` is an open-source, platform-agnostic framework for note-taking and personal knowledge management (PKM). `notebook` aims to combine simplicity and power, and is designed to be unobtrusive yet flexible, providing a minimal core functionality while opening up limitless possibilities through a robust plugin architecture.

## Design Philosophy

- **A Lifelong App**: `notebook` is designed to evolve with you, serving as an ever-improving personal trove of dataâ€”a living document for your evolving knowledge landscape.

- **Data Freedom**: "Your data" should be taken literally, meaning "you own it" and "you control it". Your data should never be locked into a platform, it should be fully portable and you should be in complete control of access permissions.

- **Seamless Integration**: `notebook` is crafted to integrate seamlessly with the tools you already know and love. Be it vim, emacs, vscode, or a web, mobile, or desktop interface, your data should be accessible where and how you want it.

- **Endless functionality**: `notebook` doesn't assume to know every feature you want or need, but it's designed to accommodate them all. From AI integration to technologies yet unknown, `notebook` is designed to evolve gracefully with whatever comes next.

- **Optimized for Learning**: With `notebook`, the goal is to learn once and never forget. It is designed not just for storing knowledge, but also for organizing, retrieving, and effectively utilizing what you've learned.

## Development Status

`notebook` is currently under active development. Please note that it is in a pre-release stage and as such, is not ready for general use.

We encourage developers, prospective users, and the curious to watch this repository for updates and contribute to its growth. As we continue to make progress, we will update the README with more information about getting started, examples, detailed documentation, and more.
